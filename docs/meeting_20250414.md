DONE:
- example formatter with quotes?
- Not clear what 6 question to delete. Not really less answered, too easy/difficult, not related to number of answer options.
    - id 24,25,26,27 refers to figure we don't have
    - id 91 also refers to figure?
- DBE-KT22:
    - what to do with students that answered questions multiple times? keep first!
    - use IRT estimation to get ground truth in DBE-KT22!
- splitting: split on question_id! (not interactions)
- refactor prompt building (bring message building inside modular function) to make it more flexible.

TODO:
- why is discrimination range [+1, +1] in IRT estimation?
- Llama4?
- How do we handle roleplaying?
- When filtering in student history, do we only show question-answer records from past interactions? -> add metadata in pinecone documents.
