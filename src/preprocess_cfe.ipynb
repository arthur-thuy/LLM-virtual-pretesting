Thirdly, the end-of-conference party <NS type=\"TV\"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be a small disco, with a variety of drinks and food provided. Therefore, you <NS type=\"TV\"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> wear something quite casual.</p>\n<p>Lastly, on the last day, I would suggest you <NS type=\"FV\"><i>to visit</i><c>visit</c></NS> the Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum, as both of them are very interesting and have <NS type=\"RD\"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> student discount.</p>\n<p>I hope this letter <NS type=\"RV\"><i>should</i><c>can</c></NS> help you with enough information.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n</coded_answer>",

The TV is so important that you can see <NS type=\"RA\"><i>it</i><c>one</c></NS> in every <NS type=\"RN\"><i>family</i><c>home</c></NS>, and it is <NS type=\"FD\"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> essential <NS type=\"RN\"><i>equipment</i><c>item</c></NS> for everyone.</p>\n<p>First of <NS type=\"S\"><i>al</i><c>all</c></NS>, in my opinion, TV has a great <NS type=\"DJ\"><i>education</i><c>educational</c></NS> <NS type=\"AGN\"><i>functions</i><c>function</c></NS>, and <NS type=\"MA\"><c>it</c></NS> also makes the world <NS type=\"UV\"><i>become</i></NS> <NS type=\"FJ\"><i>small</i><c>smaller</c></NS>. You can just sit at home <NS type=\"R\"><i>then</i><c>and</c></NS> you can know what is happening all over the world at <NS type=\"RD\"><i>the</i><c>that</c></NS> moment. I would rather <NS type=\"FV\"><i>watching</i><c>watch</c></NS> the news on TV <NS type=\"RP\"><i>in stead</i><c>instead</c></NS> of reading <NS type=\"R\"><i>in</i><c>a</c></NS> newspaper or <NS type=\"RV\"><i>hearing</i><c>listening</c></NS> <NS type=\"RT\"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type=\"MD\"><c>the</c></NS> radio because the news on TV <NS type=\"AGV\"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type=\"RJ\">vivid</NS>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the TV is <NS type=\"UD\"><i>a</i></NS> great company for <NS type=\"UD\"><i>the</i></NS> people who live alone or feel alone. I <NS type=\"UV\"><i>would</i></NS> like to <NS type=\"RV\"><i>open</i><c>turn on</c></NS> <NS type=\"MD\"><c>the</c></NS> TV when I stay at home.

You</c></NS> will feel much better than <NS type=\"M\"><i>just</i><c>you would just by</c></NS> yourself. Some TV <NS type=\"SA\"><i>programs</i><c>programmes</c></NS> are <NS type=\"S\"><i>enjouable</i><c>enjoyable</c></NS>!</p>\n<p>However, TV also has some disadvantages. You might just <NS type=\"FV\"><i>sitting</i><c>sit</c></NS> in front of <NS type=\"MD\"><c>the</c></NS> TV for hours <NS type=\"FV\"><i>learn</i><c>learning</c></NS> nothing, or no <NS type=\"RY\"><i>more</i><c>longer</c></NS> talk with your family.

This report is <NS type=\"RV\">based</NS> on an interesting building, where you can take<NS type=\"UP\"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type=\"UT\"><i>for</i></NS> your students <NS type=\"UV\"><i>to visit</i></NS>. This building is situated in Taipei, the capital. The building is called <NS type=\"MD\"><c>the</c></NS> Chiang Kei-shek <NS type=\"S\"><i>Momerial</i><c>Memorial</c></NS> Hall. Nearly everyone knows where this building is, so if you have a chance, just ask the local people in Taipei about this building.</p>\n<p>The <NS type=\"RP\"><i><NS type=\"S\"><i>momerial</i><c>memorial</c></NS></i><c>Memorial</c></NS> Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds. As you go into the main Hall, you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei-shek<NS type=\"RP\"><i>, this</i><c>. This</c></NS> is because the building is the <NS type=\"RN\"><NS type=\"S\"><i>rememberence</i><c>remembrance</c></NS></NS> of how <NS type=\"R\">well Chiang did in History</NS>. The statue is about 20 feet high. <NS type=\"U\"><i>Next to the</i><c>The</c></NS> statue is protected by <NS type=\"UD\"><i>the</i></NS> guards<NS type=\"RP\"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> guards will change every four hours.</p>\n<p>Apart from the main Hall, there are also lots of other <NS type=\"S\"><i>gallaries</i><c>galleries</c></NS>. In these <NS type=\"S\"><i>gallaries</i><c>galleries</c></NS> there are <NS type=\"RJ\">Historical</NS> paintings<NS type=\"R\"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> antique <NS type=\"CN\"><i>furnitures</i><c>furniture</c></NS> which Chiang used. These <NS type=\"AGN\"><i>treasure</i><c>treasures</c></NS> are very old, even older than the history of America. All these treasures were brought over to Taiwan by Chiang <NS type=\"R\">during the defeat in</NS> China. They are all <NS type=\"FV\"><i>been</i><c>being</c></NS> well <NS type=\"TV\"><i>look</i><c>looked</c></NS> after.</p>\n<p>As well as all the treasures, <NS type=\"AGN\"><i>statue</i><c>statues</c></NS> and <NS type=\"RJ\">historical</NS> paintings...<NS type=\"RP\"><i>There</i><c>there</c></NS> are also <NS type=\"UP\"><i><NS type=\"S\"><i>restaurent's</i><c>restaurant's</c></NS></i><c>restaurants</c></NS> and modern <NS type=\"S\"><i>gallaries</i><c>galleries</c></NS>. When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat, or if you are fed up with <NS type=\"RJ\">historical</NS> <NS type=\"FN\"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS>, you <NS type=\"S\"><i>migh</i><c>might</c></NS> as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you <NS type=\"RV\"><i>went</i><c>want</c></NS> to visit this building I <NS type=\"TV\"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> recommend you <NS type=\"FV\"><i>to stay</i><c>stay</c></NS> at a hotel not far from the <NS type=\"S\"><i>momerial</i><c>memorial</c></NS> Hall called <NS type=\"MD\"><c>the</c></NS> Hyatt Hotel.

         "<coded_answer>\n<p>Dear Mrs. Smith,</p>\n<p>I am writing in reply to your letter. I am sorry about Richard Brown. And I understand that you need help, so <NS type=\"UC\"><i>that</i></NS> I will help you as far as I can.</p>\n<p>Firstly, the hotel which <NS type=\"S\"><i>ha</i><c>has</c></NS> been booked for you is Palace Hotel <NS type=\"RA\"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> is located close to the conference. In order to get from the hotel to the conference, you just need to take the bus we will <NS type=\"RV\"><i>offer</i><c>provide</c></NS>. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m., which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference. The party is arranged as a casual party, therefore, you can wear comfortable clothes. You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well. Finally, if you want to have an exciting experience <NS type=\"UT\"><i>in</i></NS> here, I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals. As you may <NS type=\"TV\"><i>hear</i><c>have heard</c></NS>, our city is well known for the musicals. Or, <NS type=\"RP\"><i>If</i><c>if</c></NS> you want to relax, you can take a walk in the park situated <NS type=\"RT\"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> ten <NS type=\"MP\"><i>minutes</i><c>minutes'</c></NS> distance on foot from the hotel. Whatever you choose, you will be satisfied with your choice.</p>\n<p>If you have more questions about the conference <NS type=\"RC\"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> <NS type=\"RA\"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS> else, do not hesitate to ask me. I would be glad to be able to help you.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely, </p>\n</coded_answer>",
