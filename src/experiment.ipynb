       "[{'input': 'Context:\\nFrom around 2015, after years of sales growth, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had flattened out, or even fallen in some cases, introducing new doubts about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive even admitted recently that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with his company losing too much confidence in the power of the word on the page. Yet despite the obvious conclusion that digital and print can easily coexist in the market, the question of whether the ebook will kill the print book still continues to surface. It doesnt matter if the intention is to predict or dismiss this possibility; what is significant is the fact that the potential disappearance of the book does not cease to stimulate our imagination or provoke intense debate.\\nWhy is this idea so powerful? Why do we frame the encounter between ebooks and print books in terms of a struggle, even if all the evidence is to the contrary? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and tell us much more about the mixture of exhilaration and fear we feel about innovation and change in general. In my research, I have discussed how the idea of one medium killing another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. After television was invented, for instance, many claimed radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses; people started listening in cars, during train rides and on factory floors.\\nEven the idea of the disappearing book isnt new, either. As early as 1894, there was speculation that the introduction of the phonograph would spell the demise of books: Theyd be replaced by what we today call audiobooks. This sort of thing has happened time after time. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks and smartphones  all, at one time or another, have apparently conspired to destroy print books as a source of culture and entertainment. Some claimed the end of books would result in cultural regression and decline. Others, envisioning utopian digital futures, overstated the advantages of ebooks. It is not by chance then that the idea of the death of the book surfaces in moments of technological change. This narrative, in fact, perfectly conveys the mixture of hopes and fears that characterises our deepest reactions to technological change.\\nTo understand why these reactions are so common, one has to consider that we create emotional bonds with different media as they become a core part of our life. Numerous studies have shown how we develop a close connection with objects such as books, televisions and computers, even to the extent of giving a name to our car or shouting at our laptop for not working properly. Consequently, the emergence of a new technology  like e-readers  doesnt just indicate economic and social change. It also causes us to adjust our bond with something that has become an integral part of our day-to-day life.\\nAs a result, as technology moves on, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. And its why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies. The spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe, for example, made people seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movie in the 1920s stimulated nostalgia for the older form. The same happened in the shift from analog to digital photography, and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of old books  and even for their often unpleasant smell. This should provide some reassurance to those who still worry about the disappearance of print books.\\nYet the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to provide an appealing narrative about both the transformative power of technology and our aversion to change. In fact, one of the strategies we employ in order to make sense of change is the use of narrative patterns that are commonly available and easily recognisable, such as narratives of tragedy and ending. Easy to remember and to spread, the story of the death of the book mirrors both our enthusiasm for what lies ahead, as well as our fear of losing parts of our intimate world  and finally, of ourselves.\\nQuestion: In the third paragraph, what is the writer implying with the phrase have apparently conspired?\\nOptions:\\n1. There has long been a deliberate strategy to replace books.\\n2. The conflict between books and other media is a recent development.\\n3. Eliminating books from popular culture will almost certainly prove impossible.\\n4. It may be untrue that books have been threatened by new technology.',\n",

      "[HumanMessage(content='Context:\\nSome time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins  online announcements of your whereabouts. The sites point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, Hey, Im at this place  but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere  not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous  and we are lost. \\nDepressing? Perhaps, but dont give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebritys temptations and perils  all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, its worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. \\nIn January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the WWW, as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at Cern, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once.\\nHalls ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Halls site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; hed fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told either the blog goes, or I do. Hed published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, it makes people not trust me. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to make people want to be with you, youll be disappointed. \\nIn 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrongs blog to every vice president at her company  including some whom shed mocked  and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the online distribution effect: that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that wed never dream of saying in person. But the web isnt some king of alternative reality where we can let our hair down without worrying about repercussions. Our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes.\\nArmstrongs saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of mommy bloggers and her writing supports her household. Once a poster-child for the wages of web indiscretion, she has become a virtuoso of managed self-revelation. What Armstrong has figured out is something we would all do well to remember: the web may allow us to say anything, but that doesnt mean we should.\\nQuestion: According to the fifth paragraph, what big mistake did Heather Armstrong make?\\nOptions:\\n1. She encouraged her readers to share her blog with others. \\n2. She confused reality with fiction.\\n3. She gave misleading information about her job.\\n4. She forgot that actions have consequences.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content='Question difficulty: 78.06', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\n"
