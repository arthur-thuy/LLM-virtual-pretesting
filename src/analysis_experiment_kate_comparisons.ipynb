The decomposition is lossless if the common attribute (B) is a key for at least one of the relations. In this case, B is not a key for R1 or R2, but the decomposition is still lossless because the closure of A includes all attributes (A, B, C), which means we can reconstruct the original relation. For dependency preservation, we need to check if all functional dependencies can be enforced without joining the relations.

This misconception often stems from a misunderstanding of when transactions are finalized and the irrevocable nature of a commit.', answer_explanation=\"In transaction management, the 'commit' operation makes all changes made during the transaction permanent. Any changes made before the commit cannot be undone by a subsequent rollback. The rollback command only affects changes that have not yet been committed. Thus, since the commit has already been executed before the rollback in the transaction, the rollback does nothing. This clear distinction sometimes confuses students who may erroneously think that rollback always reverses the effects of earlier operations.\", student_answer=4), StrOutputB(misconception='The student might believe that the subquery in the IN clause returns multiple course numbers because they assume that a course name like ‘Relational Databases’ could appear more than once in the Course table. This misunderstanding leads to an expectation that several rows in the Enrol table will match, rather than realizing that course names are typically unique or that only one matching course number exists.', answer_explanation=\"To correctly answer the query, the student needs to recognize that the subquery 'SELECT c.CourseNo FROM Course c WHERE CourseName = ‘Relational Databases’' is expected to return exactly one course number—assuming course names are unique. Therefore, the main query retrieves only those rows in the Enrol table that have this specific course number. A misconception that the subquery might yield multiple values (or that the IN clause automatically implies multiple results) could lead the student to choose an option indicating a greater number of rows. This misinterpretation affects future responses by causing errors in queries that involve subqueries or multiple table relationships.\", student_answer=2), StrOutputB(misconception=\"The student appears to conflate attributes or multi-valued characteristics with weak entities. In previous responses, there is evidence of a tendency to misinterpret key database concepts (for instance, confusing confidentiality with integrity). In this case, the student might mistakenly believe that items like equipment status or even trainer specialties, which are not standalone entities with identifying relationships, could be modeled as weak entities. This misconception may stem from a lack of clarity about what constitutes a weak entity – namely, an entity that does not have a full key and depends on another 'owner' entity for its identification.\", answer_explanation=\"A weak entity is one that cannot be uniquely identified solely by its own attributes; it must rely on a related strong entity and typically has a partial key. In the fitness centre scenario, the 'associate member' is an entity that is identified only in the context of its associated primary member, making it a weak entity. The student might erroneously consider other options (like equipment status, which is just an attribute of equipment, or trainer’s speciality, which is a multi-valued attribute rather than an independent entity) as weak entities. Such a misunderstanding can lead them to choose an incorrect option, reflecting confusion between attributes and entity sets that require external identification.\", student_answer=1), StrOutputB(misconception='The student may mistakenly believe that in a many‐to‐many relationship such as ‘participate’, both sides have optional (partial) participation.

For example, they may think an attribute represents a single value within a table (as indicated by option 3: 'Value') or even misinterpret it as a tuple/row due to the common usage of these terms in everyday discussions about tables. This confusion stems from mixing up the roles of schema elements (e.g., attributes or columns) with instance-level data (e.g., values or rows).\", answer_explanation=\"In the relational data model, an attribute is defined as a column in a table. It describes a property or characteristic of the entity represented by the table. A tuple (or row) represents an individual record, and a value is the specific data contained in an attribute for a particular tuple.

In contrast, while a BCNF decomposition is always lossless, it does not always preserve all functional dependencies. Students who misunderstand this trade-off may select option 1, believing that a similar guarantee applies to BCNF, or even choose options 3 or 4 if they mistakenly equate uniqueness with correctness.', student_answer=1), StrOutputB(misconception='The student may confuse the number of columns selected with the number of rows returned. From previous responses, it appears they sometimes mix up query semantics—thinking that selecting specific columns might filter or change the row count.

This confusion can lead them to expect a higher number of rows (e.g., “4” or “6”) rather than just the actual number of rows present in the table.', answer_explanation=\"A basic SELECT query retrieves all the rows from the specified table, regardless of how many columns are listed. The statement 'SELECT StudentID, Name FROM Study;' returns each row in the Study table, now only showing the StudentID and Name columns.

Given A→B, we know that knowing A gives us B. Then, since AB→C, and we already have B from A, it follows that A functionally determines C as well.

Consequently, they could erroneously conclude that R is in 3NF but not in BCNF (as in option 1) or even dismiss the correct normalization.', answer_explanation='To answer this question correctly, the student must first determine the candidate keys of the relation R given the dependencies AB → CD and BC → A. A careful analysis will reveal that AB can determine the entire relation and that BC, by determining A, along with its existing attributes, also forms a candidate key. Since every determinant in the FD set is a candidate key, the relation meets the conditions for both 3NF and BCNF.
